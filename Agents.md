## 🚀 **NEW MAJOR INITIATIVE: Mock Next.js API with MongoDB Integration**

### **Project Goal**
Transform the current frontend-only application into a full-stack solution with:
- **Static data** stored in `constants.ts` (videos, creators, categories)
- **Dynamic data** managed via Next.js API routes with MongoDB storage
- **Real-time updates** for wallet balances, transactions, and user interactions
- **Scalable architecture** ready for production deployment

### **Architecture Overview**

#### **Data Classification**
- **Static Data (constants.ts)**: Videos, creators, categories, UI configurations
- **Dynamic Data (MongoDB)**: User accounts, wallet balances, transactions, payments, subscriptions

#### **API Structure**
```
/api/
├── auth/           # Authentication endpoints
├── users/          # User management
├── creators/       # Creator profiles and analytics
├── wallet/         # Wallet operations
├── payments/       # Payment processing
├── transactions/   # Transaction history
├── subscriptions/  # Subscription management
└── analytics/      # Analytics and reporting
```

#### **MongoDB Collections**
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `creators` - Creator profiles and earnings
- `wallets` - Wallet balances and transactions
- `payments` - Payment methods and history
- `transactions` - All financial transactions
- `subscriptions` - Creator subscriptions
- `analytics` - User engagement and revenue data

### **Implementation Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup** ✅
- [x] Plan API architecture and data flow
- [x] Create comprehensive API schema documentation

#### **Phase 3: API Development** 🔄
- [x] Implement authentication APIs (login, register)
- [x] Create wallet APIs (balance, add funds)
- [x] Set up API service layer for frontend
- [x] Update constants.ts to separate static vs dynamic data
- [ ] Create user management endpoints
- [ ] Build payment method APIs
- [ ] Develop transaction and analytics APIs

#### **Phase 4: Frontend Integration** ⏳
- [ ] Update components to use new API endpoints
- [ ] Implement real-time data updates
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Test complete user flows

#### **Phase 5: Testing & Optimization** ⏳
- [ ] Comprehensive API testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security validation
- [ ] Documentation updates

### **Expected Outcomes**
- **Real-time data persistence** across browser sessions
- **Scalable backend architecture** ready for production
- **Complete user journey** from registration to payments
- **Analytics and reporting** capabilities
- **Secure authentication** and data management
